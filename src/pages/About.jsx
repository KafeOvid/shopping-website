          <h2>Our Story</h2>
          <p>
            ShopEase was founded with a simple mission: to make online shopping effortless, enjoyable, and accessible to everyone. 
            What started as a small passion project has grown into a beloved online marketplace offering a carefully curated selection 
            of products across multiple categories.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our journey began when our founders noticed how complicated and time-consuming online shopping had become. 
            Too many choices, confusing interfaces, and unpredictable quality were making what should be a pleasant 
            experience into a chore. We set out to change that by creating a streamlined platform with only the best products, 
            presented in a clean, intuitive interface.
